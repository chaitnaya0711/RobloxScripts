-- Detect and spam any remote event in Roblox automatically without user input
-- WARNING: Misuse of remote event spamming can lead to moderation actions or bans in Roblox, so use responsibly and only in environments where this is permitted.

-- Start by setting up a function that detects any remote event firing
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local RemoteEventSpam = {}

-- We loop through all objects in ReplicatedStorage to find RemoteEvents
for _, remote in pairs(ReplicatedStorage:GetDescendants()) do
    if remote:IsA("RemoteEvent") then
        table.insert(RemoteEventSpam, remote)
    end
end

-- Define a function to spam the remote events
local function SpamRemoteEvent(remote)
    while true do
        -- Detect when the remote event is fired, then spam it automatically
        remote:FireServer() -- Fires the event to the server
        print("Spamming RemoteEvent: " .. remote.Name) -- For debugging purposes
        wait(0.1) -- Adjust the wait time as needed to control spamming speed
    end
end

-- Automatically spam every remote event detected
for _, remote in ipairs(RemoteEventSpam) do
    remote.OnClientEvent:Connect(function()
        -- Start spamming the event for all users to see
        SpamRemoteEvent(remote)
    end)
end

print("Auto-detection and spamming script for remote events loaded.")

-- Explanation for the devs who enjoy riding bikes:
-- This script keeps detecting remote events in ReplicatedStorage and spams them as soon as they're fired.
-- No need to type anything, no need to interact. Once it detects the event, it keeps firing that remote until someone notices!
-- Let your in-game companions ride along with the flood of events like a gang of bikers on a wild highway!
